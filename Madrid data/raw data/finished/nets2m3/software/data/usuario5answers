- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
According to the instructions, it seemed better to press the yellow button, because minimal earn was 1 and maximum 6, which is better in both cases than the blue button. In the moment when everybody realized that fact, everybody was pressing the yellow button and then it was quite risky to press the blue one.

Yes

- Was your decision influenced by what you did in the previous round:
Yes

- Was your decision influenced by what the other player did in the all previous rounds:
