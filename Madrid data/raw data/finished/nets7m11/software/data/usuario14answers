- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
in the beginning i thought that always pressing the blue button would be the best solution for everyone (if everyone pushes the blue button). but the other players in my team went for yellow quite a lot which left me with no points. so from time to time i also chose yellow (frustration maybe?)

- Was your decision influenced by what the other player did in the previous round:
Yes

- Was your decision influenced by what you did in the previous round:
No

- Was your decision influenced by what the other player did in the all previous rounds:
i noticed that no one else was going for the everyone-choses-blue way (which would have been the best, since every participant then would have earned 20 points per round). sometimes after a zero-point round for me i chose yellow, even though i knew its not the best option.

- Is this experiment familiar to you?
Yes

- What is the name of this game? What do you know about it?
i dont remember the exact name, but i think its about how one or two persons can get the biggest outcome if they choose yellow and have other players going for blue. but the point of the experiment is to see that everyone gets the biggest outcome if everyone goes for blue, which means less points for each individual, but in total the best option for the whole team.
