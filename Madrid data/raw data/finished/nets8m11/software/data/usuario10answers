- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
I applied different strategies.
1. first, charity: blue so others could gain more
2. then a pulsating pattern too see if I could ride the wave of oscillation
3. then choosing 'blue' if there where at least as many blue patterns as yellow (max common gain if everyone picked blue) and punishing them with yellow if they chose yellow

- Comments:
I was disappointed we didn't converge to blue :-)

maybe you could change the light darker/lighter to give people a feeling of the general atmosphere (more/less blue) which is, of course against the philosophy of studying the emergence of collective behaviour from individual behaviour. but, in real life we do feel collective consequences (like crime / negative economical climate) so giving feedback of an aggregated global metric does make sense...
