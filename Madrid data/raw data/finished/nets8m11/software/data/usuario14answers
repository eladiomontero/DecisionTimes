- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
I wanted to start by always pushing the blue button, because I thought if everyone said blue all the time it would be the best for everyone. Though when others started to press yellow a lot I was pressing yellow to "punish" then. Then I tried to guess what people would press based on their performance from the round before (not a great strategy). At the end I just went back to pressing blue all the time.
