- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
In the beginning i tried to earn the other people's trust by pressing blue a few times in a row, but after i earned that trust i almost always pressed yellow for the biggest gain. So about 85% of the time i pressed yellow as long as some other people pressed blue.

- Was your decision influenced by what the other player did in the previous round:
Yes

- Was your decision influenced by what you did in the previous round:
Yes

- Was your decision influenced by what the other player did in the all previous rounds:
Yes, to the extend that i had to convince the other people to press blue so i could gain the most. If the other people got in a mood of just pressing yellow, i gave them a few rounds of blue before pressing yellow again.

- Is this experiment familiar to you?
Yes

- What is the name of this game? What do you know about it?
In my class of microeconomics i learned about this game. I don't know the name anymore, but the mindset of people is so that in the long run everyone starts thinking just about themselves instead of the biggest gain for the community (if everyone chooses blue, the communal gain is the largest). So that you will get a suboptimal equilibrium where everyone chooses for themselves instead of the biggest gain in total.
