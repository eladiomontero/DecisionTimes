- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
I pushed the blue button as often as possible and used the yellow one only if everyone around me chose yellow (in order to "punish" them).

- Was your decision influenced by what the other player did in the previous round:
Yes

- Was your decision influenced by what you did in the previous round:
Yes

- Was your decision influenced by what the other player did in the all previous rounds:
I tried to infer the strategy of the other players. For instance, one player nearly always played yellow, so I knew that it was nearly impossible to make him/her switch to blue. Other players had a more complex strategy and had a tendency of playing blue after I played blue. So, I could just play yellow then blue then yellow.

- Is this experiment familiar to you?
Yes

- What is the name of this game? What do you know about it?
I don't remember the exact definitions of the games, looks a bit like a Prisoner's dilemma or maybe stug-hunt. There does not seem to be a winning strategy, if the lattice becomes blue, some people will always start playing yellow.
