<b>THE EXPERIMENT </b><br><br>


The experiment consists of an undetermined number of turns or rounds,
and it will last around an hour and never more than two. 
The rules are the same for all participants and in every round. 

<br><br>
You will be paired with another random participant during the whole experiments. 
Both you and the other participant will be anonimus during the whole game. 
Therefore you will never know who is the other person and that person will never know who are you. They will not even know your username.
The amount of money you earn in each round depends of both your decision and the decision of the other participant.

<br><br>

All the amounts will be added up at the end.
Apart from that money, you also recive an amount of 2.5 euros for participating.
