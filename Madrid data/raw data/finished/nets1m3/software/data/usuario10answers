- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
The optimal strategy is to collaborate, so choose blue, because if everybody does that everybody wind 20 points each time. At first, I chose blue several times, but all my neighbors were almost systematically yellow (non collaborative), which means that collaboration was not possible.
Since it wasnt viable, I started choosing yellow most of the time and since Im surrounded by yellow player, didnt win much. When all of our wins were low, I switched to blue, hoping that they would see the advantages of collaboration, but they stubbornly stuck with yellow, which made collaboration almost hopeless.
By the end of the game, I almost always played yellow, since the other players very rarely switched to blue and it was an overall loss to me.
