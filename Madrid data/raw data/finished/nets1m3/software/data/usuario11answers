- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
chossing the yellow option was the key for me. the lowest value I coulg win was 4 instead the blue that was 0. CHossing all the time yellow and having the probability (low but possible) that all 4 choose blue I could win 24 poinst instead of 20 choosing blue. TAking in account that the chooses are random without following a patron of decisions it was more possible to only coincide with 2-3 neighbours than with all of them.

- Comments:
Interesting game to see the behaviour at time of choices. All time during the experiment I was thinking about looking for a patron of behaviour from the other players or from myself.
