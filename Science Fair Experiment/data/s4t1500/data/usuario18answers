- Please describe briefly how did you make the decision what to do:
based on the first few rounds, when my counterprt played yellow, i realised, he/she is going for "safe" gain (either 4 or 1 point) while I was trying to be "nice" with putting blue (to let us both have 3 points each). my counterpart kept playing yellow almost all the time, so i played "their" way for a while, then changed again for "blue"...and soon we played "blue" till the end of the game (which is best for both parties)...but one needs to get to that "agreement"
